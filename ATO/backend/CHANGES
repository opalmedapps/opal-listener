 -     -- Reverted changes to Patient information         -- Patient table will now only have one entry. Instead of having multiple of the         same patient from multiple source databases. Information is the same so...         -- This means taking out any reference of UserSerNum as well.
 - Merge branch 'release-0.2' into develop

 -     --- Modified all the above scripts to track the source database serial number         This allows more modular functionality to use different queries from different databases.         Implemented ARIA.         Also changed the target database to include the source database serial numbers.

Version 0.1.1:
 - Merge branch 'hotfix-0.1.1'
 -     -- Removed if statement checking patient appointments within a date range         If a patient does not have an appointment to within a day from today then,         the script would ignore every other filter, which is what we don't want.         Commented out the line so that even if a patient does not have an appointment,         it would still go through each filter and check.

Version 0.1.0
 -     -- Updated gitignore to ignore configuration file (Configs.pm)         All credentials and directories are specified in this module. However,         to avoid constantly switching between PRO and DEV variables, I made this module         that will remain in the respective environment and any other scripts use constants         in the module.
 -     --- Task.pm         -- Fixed a syntax error that crashed dataControl.pl
 -     --- Alias.pm         -- Added line to sql query to keep LastUpdated as is when updating the LastTransferred column             If LastTransferred was updated, then LastUpdate updated its date as well (on update clause). The frontend             relies on LastUpdated to see if any aliases have changed (e.g. name, description, etc.). The LastTransferred             column should be ignored.
 -     ---- Implemented new features to ATO ----         Made neccessary changes to existing scripts...
 - 	-- Added function to logically update the "Next Cron" datetime 		For properly viewing the next cron datetime in the interface.
 -     -- Changed Alias function back to LastUpdated (from LastTransferred)         Noticed each module that uses Alias module calls this function and it was originally         called setLastUpdatedIntoOurDB. Didn't feel like going into each module and modifying the name.         I will eventually...     -- Commented out MH calls in Document         Triggers are activated now.     -- Removed RevCount in Document table.         No need for this column, so any references were removed in Document.pm except setters/getters.         (Just in case).     -- Fixed wrong column call in getting Patients marked for transfer         Was calling LastUpdated instead of LastTransferred.
 -     -- Modifications based on changes made in DB         In Alias and PatientControl tables the LastUpdated column was changed to LastTransferred         as a more accurate description of what that field represents. A new LastUpdated field         has been added in both tables to actually reflect any changes made within entried of         those tabels (Ex: changing the alias name -- LastUpdate will update; LastTransferred remains         the same; only triggered by the dataControl script)
 -     -- Added Diagnosis Code to module     -- Simple layout-of-code fix in Document.pm
 - 	-- Added approved by and timestamp to module 		Staff module added to reassigning id with serial for approvedby
 -     -- Changed pdfDir to be a new location outside of html directories         To remove access from URL.
 -     -- Added conditional in Document.pm         If the document in ARIA repository was already .pdf, then no document would have         been copied over because the if statement only looked for initial .doc's.         So, I added the coditional that if the document is already pdf, then just         copy it over.
 -     -- Fixed an issue with primary key for Document MH table         The serial was not being transferred when inserting document info into the database         So each time, it was inserting NULL, which is 0, and this created a conflict in the         DocumentMH table because the serial had to be unique.
 -     -- Added Photo module         Currently, this is not needed. Originially, a separate table in our database         called Photo would be filled out with patient's photos but it was suggested that         we simply put the photo in the Patient table. We would get the patient's photo         upon registration. So this is currently handled by the registration script for the app.         So currently, there's no need to check for updates on patients' photos.         Photo module is set up just in case...
 -     -- Added transfer of documents         Now documents can be sent to a local repository from the ARIA directory, ATS style.
 -     -- Modified scripts to be AEHRA-style
 -     -- Added Cron.pm module         To handle cron logs. Setting them at the appropriate         instances (in dataControl.pl) for logging purposes.
 -     -- Initial commit.
