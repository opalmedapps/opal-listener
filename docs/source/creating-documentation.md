Documentation pages made for JSDoc are called "Tutorials", and can be created in a variety of formats, including `.md`.
To add a new page to this documentation site, create a `.md` file in the `docs/source` folder.
Then, add an entry to `docs/source/config.json` with the file name as the key, and an object specifying its title
as the value.
