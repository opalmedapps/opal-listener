     *              Background: Promise.any() is used to find the first Promise in an array to succeed, but it doesn't
     *              tell us which one succeeded.
     *              See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any
     * @param {Promise[]|Promise} promiseArray An array of promises where we only care about the first one to succeed
     *                                         (or if they all fail).
     * @returns {Promise<unknown>} Resolves to an object containing the value and index of the first promise to resolve,
     *                             or rejects with an AggregateError if all promises reject.
